Add optional or mandatory add-ons to the cart with main items. Create smart bundles that automatically link and sell additional products effortlessly.

== Description ==
**Force Sells and Smart Bundles for WooCommerce** allows you to add optional or mandatory add-on products to the cart whenever a main item is added.

- Automatically link and sell additional products with ease.
- When a main item is added to the cart, its associated linked products are also added.
- Mandatory products are synchronized with the main item’s quantity. Optional products can be removed from the cart without affecting the main item.
- The quantity of mandatory items is always synced with the main item (e.g., if one main item is added, one mandatory item will also be in the cart).
- Flexible display settings enable you to choose where the force-sell products should appear (before or after the "Add to Cart" button).
- Customize the layout of force-sell items as list view or grid view, and choose whether to show product images.

The plugin is highly developer-friendly, allowing you to easily add more functionalities with our hooks.
